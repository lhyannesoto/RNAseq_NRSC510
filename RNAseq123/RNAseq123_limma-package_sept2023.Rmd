###Setup
Install the BiocManager
```{r}
if (!require("BiocManager", quietly = TRUE))
  + install.packages("BiocManager")
#BiocManager::install("limma")
#install.packages("devtools")
#devtools::install_github("hasaru-k/GlimmaV2")
#install.packages("R.utils")
library('devtools')
library("BiocManager")
library("limma")
library("Glimma")
library("R.utils")

```

Download the file and extract the relevant files from this archive
```{r}
#url <- "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/download/?acc=GSE63310&format=file"
#utils::download.file(url, destfile="GSE63310_RAW.tar", mode="wb") 
utils::untar("GSE63310_RAW.tar", exdir = ".")
files <- c("GSM1545535_10_6_5_11.txt", "GSM1545536_9_6_5_11.txt", "GSM1545538_purep53.txt",
  "GSM1545539_JMS8-2.txt", "GSM1545540_JMS8-3.txt", "GSM1545541_JMS8-4.txt",
  "GSM1545542_JMS8-5.txt", "GSM1545544_JMS9-P7c.txt", "GSM1545545_JMS9-P8c.txt")
for(i in paste(files, ".gz", sep=""))
  R.utils::gunzip(i, overwrite=TRUE)

```

Each of these text files contains the raw gene-level counts for a given sample. Note that our analysis only includes the basal, LP and ML samples from this experiment (see associated file names below).

```{r}
files <- c("GSM1545535_10_6_5_11.txt", "GSM1545536_9_6_5_11.txt", 
   "GSM1545538_purep53.txt", "GSM1545539_JMS8-2.txt", 
   "GSM1545540_JMS8-3.txt", "GSM1545541_JMS8-4.txt", 
   "GSM1545542_JMS8-5.txt", "GSM1545544_JMS9-P7c.txt", 
   "GSM1545545_JMS9-P8c.txt")
read.delim(files[1], nrow=5)
```

Use edgeR to conveniently used readDGE function.
Note: you can read each text file into R separately and combine them into a matrix of counts but edgeR let's us  do this in one step with this function. 
```{r}
library('edgeR')
x <- readDGE(files, columns=c(1,3))
class(x)
```

The resulting DGEList-object contains a matrix of counts with 27,179 rows associated with unique Entrez gene identifiers (IDs) and nine columns associated with the individual samples in the experiment.
```{r}
dim(x)
```

If the counts from all samples were stored in a single file, the data can be read into R and then converted into a DGEList-object using the DGEList function

-----

###Organising sample information

Our DGEList-object contains a samples data frame that stores both cell type (or group) and batch (sequencing lane) information, each of which consists of three distinct levels. Note that within x$samples, library sizes are automatically calculated for each sample and normalisation factors are set to 1. For simplicity, we remove the GEO sample IDs (GSM*) from the column names of our DGEList-object x.

```{r}
samplenames <- substring(colnames(x), 12, nchar(colnames(x)))
samplenames
```

```{r}
colnames(x) <- samplenames
group <- as.factor(c("LP", "ML", "Basal", "Basal", "ML", "LP", 
                     "Basal", "ML", "LP"))
x$samples$group <- group
lane <- as.factor(rep(c("L004","L006","L008"), c(3,4,2)))
x$samples$lane <- lane
x$samples
```

### 4.3 Organising gene annotations

```{r}
geneid <- rownames(x)
library('dplyr')
if (!require("BiocManager", quietly = TRUE))
    install.packages("BiocManager")
#BiocManager::install("Mus.musculus")
#BiocManager::install('GenomeInfoDb')
library('GenomeInfoDb')
library('Biostrings')
library('GenomicRanges')
library('SummarizedExperiment')
library('Mus.musculus')
genes <- select(Mus.musculus, keys=geneid, columns=c("SYMBOL", "TXCHROM"), 
                keytype="ENTREZID")
```

```{r}
genes <-genes[!duplicated(genes$ENTREZID),]

x$genes<-genes
x
```

27174 more rows ...

$genes
27174 more rows ...

In this example, the gene order is the same in both the annotation and the data object. If this is not the case due to missing and/or rearranged gene IDs, the match function can be used to order genes correctly. The data frame of gene annotations is then added to the data object and neatly packaged in a DGEList-object containing raw count data with associated sample information and gene annotations.

### 5) Data pre-processing
##5.1)Transformations from the raw-scale
```{r}
cpm<-cpm(x)
lcpm<-cpm(x, log=TRUE)
```



CPM value of 1 means you have 20 counts in the sample with the lowest sequencing depth

log-CPM values will be used for exploratory plots

When log=TRUE, the cpm function adds an offset to the CPM values before converting to the log2-scale. 

```{r}
L <- mean(x$samples$lib.size) * 1e-6
M <- median(x$samples$lib.size) * 1e-6
c(L, M)
```

```{r}
summary(lcpm)
```

```{r}
table(rowSums(x$counts==0)==9)
```

```{r}
keep.exprs <- filterByExpr(x, group=group)
x <- x[keep.exprs,, keep.lib.sizes=FALSE]
dim(x)
```


```{r}
lcpm.cutoff <- log2(10/M + 2/L)
library(RColorBrewer)
nsamples <- ncol(x)
col <- brewer.pal(nsamples, "Paired")
par(mfrow=c(1,2))
plot(density(lcpm[,1]), col=col[1], lwd=2, ylim=c(0,0.26), las=2, main="", xlab="")
title(main="A. Raw data", xlab="Log-cpm")
abline(v=lcpm.cutoff, lty=3)
for (i in 2:nsamples){
den <- density(lcpm[,i])
lines(den$x, den$y, col=col[i], lwd=2)
}
legend("topright", samplenames, text.col=col, bty="n")
lcpm <- cpm(x, log=TRUE)
plot(density(lcpm[,1]), col=col[1], lwd=2, ylim=c(0,0.26), las=2, main="", xlab="")
title(main="B. Filtered data", xlab="Log-cpm")
abline(v=lcpm.cutoff, lty=3)
for (i in 2:nsamples){
den <- density(lcpm[,i])
lines(den$x, den$y, col=col[i], lwd=2)
}
legend("topright", samplenames, text.col=col, bty="n")
```

Figure 1: The density of log-CPM values for raw pre-filtered data (A) and post-filtered data (B) are shown for each sample
Dotted vertical lines mark the log-CPM threshold (equivalent to a CPM value of about 0.2) used in the filtering step.

####5.3) Normalising gene expression distributions

```{r}
x <- calcNormFactors(x, method = "TMM")
x$samples$norm.factors
```

```{r}
x2 <- x
x2$samples$norm.factors <- 1
x2$counts[,1] <- ceiling(x2$counts[,1]*0.05)
x2$counts[,2] <- x2$counts[,2]*5
```

The figure below shows the expression distribution of samples for unnormalised and normalised data, where distributions are noticeably different pre-normalisation and are similar post-normalisation. Here the first sample has a small TMM scaling factor of 0.06, whereas the second sample has a large scaling factor of 6.08 – neither values are close to 1.

```{r}
par(mfrow=c(1,2))
lcpm <- cpm(x2, log=TRUE)
boxplot(lcpm, las=2, col=col, main="")
title(main="A. Example: Unnormalised data",ylab="Log-cpm")
x2 <- calcNormFactors(x2)  
x2$samples$norm.factors
```

```{r}
lcpm <- cpm(x2, log=TRUE)
boxplot(lcpm, las=2, col=col, main="")
title(main="B. Example: Normalised data",ylab="Log-cpm")
```

Figure 2: Example data: Boxplots of log-CPM values showing expression distributions for unnormalised data (A) and normalised data (B) for each sample in the modified dataset where the counts in samples 1 and 2 have been scaled to 5% and 500% of their original values respectively

####5.4) Unsuperived clustering of samples

In our opinion, one of the most important exploratory plots to examine for gene expression analyses is the multi-dimensional scaling (MDS) plot, or similar. 

```{r}
lcpm <- cpm(x, log=TRUE)
par(mfrow=c(1,2))
col.group <- group
levels(col.group) <-  brewer.pal(nlevels(col.group), "Set1")
col.group <- as.character(col.group)
col.lane <- lane
levels(col.lane) <-  brewer.pal(nlevels(col.lane), "Set2")
col.lane <- as.character(col.lane)
plotMDS(lcpm, labels=group, col=col.group)
title(main="A. Sample groups")
plotMDS(lcpm, labels=lane, col=col.lane, dim=c(3,4))
title(main="B. Sequencing lanes")

```


Figure 3: MDS plots of log-CPM values over dimensions 1 and 2 with samples coloured and labeled by sample groups (A) and over dimensions 3 and 4 with samples coloured and labeled by sequencing lane (B)
Distances on the plot correspond to the leading fold-change, which is the average (root-mean-square) log2-fold-change for the 500 genes most divergent between each pair of samples by default.

```{r}
glMDSPlot(lcpm, labels=paste(group, lane, sep="_"), 
          groups=x$samples[,c(2,5)], launch=FALSE)
```

####6) Differential expression analysis
6.1) Creating a design matrix and contrasts

```{r}
design <- model.matrix(~0+group+lane)
colnames(design) <- gsub("group", "", colnames(design))
design
```
```{r}
contr.matrix <- makeContrasts(
   BasalvsLP = Basal-LP, 
   BasalvsML = Basal - ML, 
   LPvsML = LP - ML, 
   levels = colnames(design))
contr.matrix
```

####6.2) Removing heteroscedascity from count data

```{r}
par(mfrow=c(1,2))
v <- voom(x, design, plot=TRUE)
v
```

Figure 4: Means (x-axis) and variances (y-axis) of each gene are plotted to show the dependence between the two before voom is applied to the data (left panel) and how the trend is removed after voom precision weights are applied to the data (right panel)

```{r}
vfit <- lmFit(v, design)
vfit <- contrasts.fit(vfit, contrasts=contr.matrix)
efit <- eBayes(vfit)
plotSA(efit, main="Final model: Mean-variance trend")
```


####6.3) Fitting linear models for comparisons of interest

Linear modelling in limma is carried out using the lmFit and contrasts.fit functions originally written for application to microarrays. The functions can be used for both microarray and RNA-seq data and fit a separate model to the expression values for each gene. Next, empirical Bayes moderation is carried out by borrowing information across all the genes to obtain more precise estimates of gene-wise variability (Smyth 2004). The model’s residual variances are plotted against average expression values in the next figure. It can be seen from this plot that the variance is no longer dependent on the mean expression level.



####6.4) Examining the number of DE genes

```{r}
summary(decideTests(efit))
```



```{r}
tfit <- treat(vfit, lfc=1)
dt <- decideTests(tfit)
summary(dt)
```



```{r}
de.common <- which(dt[,1]!=0 & dt[,2]!=0)
length(de.common)
```


```{r}
head(tfit$genes$SYMBOL[de.common], n=20)
```


```{r}
vennDiagram(dt[,1:2], circle.col=c("turquoise", "salmon"))
```


Figure 5: Venn diagram showing the number of genes DE in the comparison between basal versus LP only (left), basal versus ML only (right), and the number of genes that are DE in both comparisons (center)
The number of genes that are not DE in either comparison are marked in the bottom-right.

```{r}
write.fit(tfit, dt, file="results.txt")
```


####6.5) Examining individual DE genes from top to bottom
The top DE genes can be listed using topTreat for results using treat (or topTable for results using eBayes). By default topTreat arranges genes from smallest to largest adjusted p-value with associated gene information, log-FC, average log-CPM, moderated t-statistic, raw and adjusted p-value for each gene. The number of top genes displayed can be specified, where n=Inf includes all genes. Genes Cldn7 and Rasef are amongst the top DE genes for both basal versus LP and basal versus ML.

```{r}
basal.vs.lp <- topTreat(tfit, coef=1, n=Inf)
basal.vs.ml <- topTreat(tfit, coef=2, n=Inf)
head(basal.vs.lp)
```

```{r}
head(basal.vs.ml)
```

####6.6) Useful graphical representations of differential expression results

```{r}
plotMD(tfit, column=1, status=dt[,1], main=colnames(tfit)[1], 
       xlim=c(-8,13))
```

Glimma extends this functionality by providing an interactive mean-difference plot via the glMDPlot function. The output of this function is an html page, with summarised results in the left panel (similar to what is output by plotMD), and the log-CPM values from individual samples for a selected gene in the right panel, with a table of results below the plots. This interactive display allows the user to search for particular genes based on the annotation provided (e.g. Gene symbol identifier), which is not possible in a static R plot.




```{r}
glMDPlot(tfit, coef=1, status=dt, main=colnames(tfit)[1],
         side.main="ENTREZID", counts=lcpm, groups=group, launch=FALSE)
```








```{r}
library(gplots)
basal.vs.lp.topgenes <- basal.vs.lp$ENTREZID[1:100]
i <- which(v$genes$ENTREZID %in% basal.vs.lp.topgenes)
mycol <- colorpanel(1000,"blue","white","red")
heatmap.2(lcpm[i,], scale="row",
   labRow=v$genes$SYMBOL[i], labCol=group, 
   col=mycol, trace="none", density.info="none", 
   lhei=c(2,10), dendrogram="column")
```



Figure 6: Heatmap of log-CPM values for top 100 genes DE in basal versus LP

Expression across each gene (or row) have been scaled so that mean expression is zero and standard deviation is one. Samples with relatively high expression of a given gene are marked in red and samples with relatively low expression are marked in blue. Lighter shades and white represent genes with intermediate expression levels. Samples and genes have been reordered by the method of hierarchical clustering. A dendrogram is shown for the sample clustering.

####7) Gene set testing with camera

Camera method

```{r}
load(system.file("extdata", "mouse_c2_v5p1.rda", package = "RNAseq123"))
idx <- ids2indices(Mm.c2,id=rownames(v))
cam.BasalvsLP <- camera(v,idx,design,contrast=contr.matrix[,1])
head(cam.BasalvsLP,5)
```



















```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
